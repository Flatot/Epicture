Ux/Ui choices:

	The first choice we made was to use a Bottom Navigation Bar.
	It's very easy to use it and it's fast to switch.

	The five most important parts in this project is in this Bottom Navigation Bar.

		- Search viewer
		- Upload viewer
		- Profil viewer / personnal pictures viewer

	Filters icon is accessible in the top right corner.
